# SethHeeckv4.3
SethHeeck v4.3 converted and fixed GM13

NOTE: This is currently still broken and NOT running correctly. Any help or advice is appreciated. Updates will still go out for fixing this just note
that it may take some time. Until it is fully functional this notice will remain in place.

Once this is fully functional I will rebuild a C++ module for it and add it to the repo

Quack Anti-Cheat V9 when?
